# SeeChatGPT

[Explainer Video to be released here](http://youtube.com/c/ChaiTimeDataScience/)

A cleaner, sleeker implementation of VisualChatGPT, written in [Wave ❤️](http://wave.h2o.ai), to run on a single GPU instead of 8xGPUs. 

We have also cleaned up the code-base so that you can extend and experiment flexibly.
